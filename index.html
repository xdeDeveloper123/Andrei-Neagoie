  <h1>Andrei Neagoie</h1>
  <p><em>Founder and CTO of <strong><a href="https://zerotomastery.io/">Zero To Mastry Learning Bootcamp</a></strong></em></p>
  <p> <em>A Senior Software Developer.</em></p>

  <p>Andrei, lead instructor of Zero To Mastery Academy, has taught more than 1,000,000 students worldwide, many of whom now work for world-class
    companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, Tesla, IBM, Facebook, Shopify and many more.</p>
  <p>Andrei has worked as a Senior Software Developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years. Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating his time to teaching others valuable software development skills so
    they can take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.</p>
  <p>Having been a self-taught programmer himself, Andrei understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials
    and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching real-life skills.</p>
  <p>Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter and
  they arenâ€™t able to spend thousands of dollars on a coding bootcamp.</p>
  <p><strong>Andrei believes that programming skills should be affordable and
    open to all and that educational materials should teach current, real-life skills and topics.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Combining his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will allow you to learn complex
  subjects in a fun and interactive way that you never thought would be possible.</p>
